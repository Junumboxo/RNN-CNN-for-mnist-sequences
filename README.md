# RNN-CNN-for-mnist-sequences

A realization of homework at Deep Learning Course.
Implemented creation of the dataset, buiding the network and the training on Keras - https://github.com/keras-team/keras

Full homework task text in [homewotk]lstm_gru.docx (Russian)
To create sequences from 10 images from mnist, and append the 11th element a11 which is a11 = a1 + a10

To train the network which would predict a11 (the number itself, not the image)
